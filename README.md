#**An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns** 

##**Overview**
   This Project is about  **Louise**, who is starting a new crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play **FEVER**. She estimated her budget for campaign around              $12000. To gain better understanding of the project she seek out for help by power Excel user.
   
##**Purpose**
   I used Excel to organize, sort and analyze the crowdfunding data to generate the insight that will help Louise understand the campaign from start to finish and she      will be able to compare her campaign with other successful ones in the same category, and hopefully that altogather help Lousie in making smart decisions.
