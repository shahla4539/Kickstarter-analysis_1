# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 

## Overview
    This Project is about  **Louise**, who is starting a new crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play **FEVER**. She estimated her budget for campaign around           $12000. To gain better understanding of the project she seek out for help by power Excel user.
   
## Purpose
    I used Excel to organize, sort and analyze the crowdfunding data to generate the insight that will help Louise understand the campaign from start to finish and she     will be able to compare her campaign with other successful ones in the same category, and hopefully that altogather help Lousie in making smart decisions. 
   
 # Analysis And Challenges 
    Firstly, , I added filter in pledge, country, outcomes, and goal columns so that Louise project is going to be in US she can view the data as per her need.I added     some conditional formatting in the **outcome** column where successful=green, failed=red,live=blue, and canceled=yellow to provide **visual presentation** of the       data in the worksheet at a glance. 
   
### Percentage Funded
    I created a **Percentage Funded** column so that Louise can easily interpret the data and quickly determine how close a campaign came to 'reaching' and in some         cases'exceeding' their funding goal.Again I with the help of conditional formating I made **Maximum** percentage funded color **blue** and moving towards               **Minimum**    percentage **red**.
  
 ### Average Donation
    I also added "Average Donation" column. This column will help Louise set up her incentive by first determinig how much money people have pledged historically. 
   
## Challenges

### Categories Challenge 
    Their were two challenges for me to make the data more readable. The first one was the **Category and Subcategory** was merged togather, therefore initially it was     hard to be very specific with the information i want to provide. To overcome that hurdle I split them into two columns as **Parent Category** and **Subcategory**.
   
### Time Format Challenge
    The Second challenge was the time. The data was orignally using **Unix timestamp**, which was not human readable format. By utilizing the converting formula I         changed the time format into human readable and added two more columns as **Date Launced Conversion** and **Date Ended Conversion**. 
   
## Year
    Also with the help of 'Date Launched Conversion" column i extracted the year of the projects which can give a quick review to Louse about how many project took         place in same years. 
   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launched Date
   To provide Louse with additional visuailization of the Data for finding how well all the campaigns performed, I created a **Pivot Table** and on that values I also prepared a **Graph**. 
   For the pivot talble
